# Welton_IlCodes
Code from my time in the Welton group (work in progress)

This repository contains code developed by me while in the  Welton group. It performs a variety of tasks, but was all originally developed for structural and dynamical analysis of ionic liquids in molecular dynamics.

These codes are freely for use with appropriate citations, as per the licence. 

Any questions on code development, use, collaboration or implementation contact myself or Tom Welton at t.welton@imperial.ac.uk.
