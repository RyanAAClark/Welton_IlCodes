# Welton_IlCodes
Code from the Welton group (work in progress)

This repository contains code developed by the Welton group. It is written in a variety of languages and performs a variety of tasks, but was all originally developed for structural and dynamical analysis of ionic liquids in molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics.

These codes are freely for use with appropriate citations, as per the licence. 

Any questions on code development, use, collaboration or implementation contact Tom Welton at t.welton@imperial.ac.uk.
